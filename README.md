# Lessy

Lessy is a Web application helping you to manage your time. It provides a todo
list and a projects manager. It was built with strong values in mind and
designed to be as intuitive and inclusive as possible.

**Important:** Lessy hasn’t be maintained for few years, and it has been
definitely stopped in April 2022. The service at [lessy.io](https://lessy.io)
will be maintained as long as they are active users, but the registrations are
closed. You’re very welcome if you wan't to fork the project!

On a personal note, I’ve been very happy to build Lessy. I learnt a lot and it
has been helpful for few years (hopefully, it still is to some people). Over
the years though, it has become less and less useful to me, to the point I went
back to paper and pencil to manage my todo list (the performance is better, and
it has less bugs!)

If you want to learn more on the history of Lessy, you can read my series
“[Lessy’s more](https://marienfressinaud.fr/serie/lessy.html)” on my blog (in
French).
